# Trading

Trading can be a useful aspect of the game, and while there is no money, the trader will take items in your inventory as long as you have an item with equal or greater value. The background will turn blue if you are currently in trading mode. Trading mode is started by see-trades

> see-trades

View all items for sale around your location.

> ask `item`

Attempt to start trading to obtain `item` from someone. You must accept or decline the offer before you are allowed to do any other action.

```{note}
> accept

accept the current trade offer

> decline

Decline the current trade offer
```

> attempt `item`

If you see nothing you would particularly want or need, you can attempt to sell an item to multiple people. This may lead to a better barter for you, however you will be limited to fewer options, compared to more options, but a worse deal from asking.

```{note}
> accept

accept the current trade offer

> decline

Decline the current trade offer
```

> return

Exits out of trading mode and returns you to the main gui so you can continue your journey.
